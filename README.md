# COM421_Website_Project

This is a website created for COM 421 at Illinois Tech.

--Walk-through--

Upon clicking the link, you will be brough to the homepage. There you see a short 'About Me' section and a menu bar on the left-hand side. The menu contains options
for the 'Home' page, 'Resume' Page, and a link to my LinkedIn profile.

On the 'Home' page, I listed my full name followed, by contact information and hometown. Underneath that is an 'About Me' section and a headshot. On the 'Resume' page,
I once again have the same header as the 'Home' page. The 'Resume' page also gives the option to download a PDF of my resume for employers
to view. This page also contains my resume, written out in HTML, if an employer did not want to download my resume.

This website is mainly written in HTML and styled with CSS components.

--What I would have done differently--

There are some parts in the .html files that have some stylistic elements, mainly '<strong>' and '<em>' as I did not want to write redundant code in CSS. I also wanted to 
add some more text in the 'About Me' section, but I felt like I didn't need to add more because it would seem unprofessional. Additionally, I wanted to add more padding
between the contact information and 'Resume | Download Resume (PDF)' on my 'Resume' page. It looks scrunched up, but it doesn't look too bad. I would also want to reduce
the padding between text on my 'Resume' page, as it feels spaced out and a lot of white space is taking up the page.
